    "content": "As a platform architect working with multiple Java microservices, I've always been passionate about maintaining clean architecture and consistent code quality. Recently, I discovered ArchUnit, and it's become an essential tool in my development workflow.\n\n## What is ArchUnit?\n\nArchUnit is a Java library that allows you to test your architecture using unit tests. Instead of relying on code reviews and documentation to enforce architectural rules, you can write tests that automatically verify your architecture decisions.\n\n## Why I Love ArchUnit\n\n### 1. Automated Architecture Enforcement\n\nBefore ArchUnit, enforcing layered architecture was manual and error-prone. Now I can write tests like:\n\n```java\n@Test\npublic void servicesShouldNotDependOnControllers() {\n    noClasses()\n        .that().resideInAPackage(\"..service..\")\n        .should().dependOnClassesThat().resideInAPackage(\"..controller..\")\n        .check(importedClasses);\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Catching Violations Early\n\nArchUnit runs as part of your test suite, catching architectural violations during development rather than in code review. This saves time and prevents technical debt from accumulating.\n\n### 3. Living Documentation\n\nYour architecture tests serve as executable documentation. New team members can read the tests to understand the intended architecture, and the tests ensure the documentation never goes stale.\n\n## Real-World Example\n\nIn my recent microservices projects, I use ArchUnit to enforce:\n\n- **Layered Architecture**: Services can't depend on controllers, repositories can't depend on services\n- **Naming Conventions**: All REST controllers must end with \"Controller\", all services with \"Service\"\n- **Dependency Rules**: Domain layer has no dependencies on infrastructure\n- **Package Structure**: Certain packages can only be accessed by specific other packages\n\n## Integration with Quality Tools\n\nI've integrated ArchUnit alongside PMD, Checkstyle, and SpotBugs in my projects. Together, these tools create a comprehensive quality gate:\n\n- **PMD**: Code quality and potential bugs\n- **Checkstyle**: Code style consistency\n- **SpotBugs**: Bug pattern detection\n- **ArchUnit**: Architecture rule enforcement\n\nThis combination has helped me achieve zero violations across multiple production projects.\n\n## Future Plans\n\nI'm now adding ArchUnit to all my new Java projects by default. I've even created project templates that include pre-configured ArchUnit tests for common architectural patterns.\n\nFor my microservices platform, I'm developing a shared ArchUnit rules library that can be reused across services, ensuring consistent architecture across the entire platform.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you're working with Java and care about architecture, I highly recommend trying ArchUnit. Start small with a few basic rules and expand as you see the value.\n\nThe investment in writing architecture tests pays off quickly through reduced technical debt and faster onboarding of new team members.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [ArchUnit Official Documentation](https://www.archunit.org/)\n- [ArchUnit GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnit)\n\n---\n\n*Note: This blog post was created with AI assistance.*",
